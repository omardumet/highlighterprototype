<p id="p">All the years I’ve been working on my own self-improvement
    and helping other guys I’ve tried really hard to figure
    out exactly why some people are successful and others aren’t.
    I've seen guys' successes on TRP, Reddit or on other forums.
    I've watched and helped my friends achieve crazy goals.
    With all the people I’ve seen make it – and even more who
    haven’t made it, I've often asked, "why did they succeed?"
